# EasyCalc ðŸ§®

This is my first website project â€” just a simple calculator to help me get used to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
I didnâ€™t really focus on design too much, I just wanted to make something that actually works.

## What it does
- Lets you add, subtract, multiply and divide
- Has a clear button (C) to reset
- Has a decimal point for non-whole numbers
- Shows the result when you press "="
- Basicallyâ€¦ it does calculator things ðŸ˜…

## Things I want to fix later
- I used way too many `<br>` tags for spacing (Iâ€™ll fix this with CSS margins/padding)
- Layout can be cleaner if I use CSS grid for the buttons
- Add keyboard support so you donâ€™t have to click everything
- Make it look less plain (colors, hover effects, better design)
- Accessibility stuff (like labels for screen readers)

## Why I built this
I just wanted to start small and practice the basics before moving on to bigger projects.  
This helped me understand how HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript events all connect together.

## Next step ðŸš€
Next time Iâ€™ll try building something more challenging like a to-do list app, or a student dashboard with multiple features.  
For now though, Iâ€™m just happy my first project runs without breaking ðŸ˜….
